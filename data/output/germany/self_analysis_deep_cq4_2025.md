## 1. Financial Health Dashboard

### 1.1 Top-Line KPIs

| Metric | CQ4 2025 | QoQ | YoY | Assessment |
|--------|---------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Total Revenue | **€3,092M** | +0.06% | **+0.72%** | Growing — slow but positive |
| Service Revenue | €2,726M | — | **+0.7%** | Core revenue growing |
| EBITDA | **€1,120M** | +0.9% | **+1.5%** | Margin expanding |
| EBITDA Margin | **36.2%** | +0.2pp | +0.8pp | Healthy, steadily improving |
| Capex | €800M | — | — | Investment intensity 25.9% |
| Opex | €1,972M | — | — | Controlled |
| Employees | 14,500 | — | — | |

**Key insight**: Vodafone Germany is in "slow growth" mode — revenue growing at just +0.7% YoY, but EBITDA margin has steadily improved from 35.4% → 36.2% over 8 quarters. This is a "managed optimization" playbook, not a growth story.

### 1.2 Revenue Trend — 8 Quarters

| Quarter | CQ1 '24 | CQ2 '24 | CQ3 '24 | CQ4 '24 | CQ1 '25 | CQ2 '25 | CQ3 '25 | **CQ4 '25 (latest)** |
|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Revenue (€M) | 3,050 | 3,080 | 3,060 | 3,070 | 3,080 | 3,090 | 3,090 | **3,092** |
| EBITDA (€M) | 1,080 | 1,090 | 1,090 | 1,100 | 1,100 | 1,110 | 1,110 | **1,120** |
| Margin (%) | 35.4 | 35.5 | 35.6 | 35.8 | 35.9 | 36.0 | 36.0 | **36.2** |

**Trend assessment**: Revenue line is essentially flat (€3,050M → €3,092M over 8 quarters = +1.4% total). The margin expansion (+0.8pp) is doing the heavy lifting — this is cost optimization, not top-line momentum.

### 1.3 Capex Efficiency — vs Competitors

| Operator | Capex/Revenue | Revenue Growth | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| DT | **19.4%** | +1.1% | Most efficient — lower capex, higher growth |
| O2 | 25.0% | -3.4% | Spending but shrinking — poor ROI |
| Vodafone | **25.9%** | +0.7% | High spend, modest return |
| 1&1 | 38.6% | +0.1% | Network build phase — expected |

**Key insight**: Vodafone spends 25.9% of revenue on capex — the second-highest ratio — but gets only +0.7% growth. DT spends 19.4% and grows at +1.1%. This suggests Vodafone's capex is going to maintenance/catch-up rather than growth-generating investment.

## 2. Revenue Breakdown & Segment Portfolio

### 2.1 Revenue Mix

| Segment | Revenue (€M/q) | Share | YoY Growth | Health |
|---------|----------------|-------|------------|--------|
| **Mobile Service** | 1,520 | **49.2%** | **+2.8%** | Stable |
| **Fixed Broadband** | 795 | **25.7%** | **-1.1%** | Under pressure |
| **B2B/Enterprise** | 520 | **16.8%** | **+8.5%** | **Strong** |
| **Wholesale** | 380 | **12.3%** | **+90.0%** | Strong (1&1 driven) |
| **TV/Convergence** | 268 | **8.7%** | **-3.6%** | Declining |
| **Total** | **3,092** | (112.7%*) | **+0.7%** | Stable |

*Note: Shares sum to >100% due to segment revenue overlap in reporting.*

**Portfolio diagnosis**:
- **Growth engines**: B2B (+8.5%) and Wholesale (+90%) are driving total revenue growth
- **Cash cow**: Mobile (49.2% share, +2.8%) — the core business is healthy
- **Drag**: Fixed broadband (-1.1%) and TV (-3.6%) are declining — the cable legacy is eroding
- **Wildcard**: Wholesale at +90% is a temporary boost from 1&1 migration; this will plateau and eventually reverse as 1&1 builds own coverage

### 2.2 Wholesale Revenue — The 1&1 Effect

| Quarter | CQ1 '24 | CQ2 '24 | CQ3 '24 | CQ4 '24 | CQ1 '25 | CQ2 '25 | CQ3 '25 | **CQ4 '25** |
|---------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Wholesale (€M) | 180 | 185 | 190 | 200 | 220 | 260 | 320 | **380** |

Wholesale has doubled from €180M → €380M in 8 quarters — almost entirely driven by 1&1's 12M subscribers migrating onto Vodafone's network. Management confirms: *"1&1 wholesale revenue reaches full run-rate in Q4."*

**Warning**: This €380M/q revenue stream is **structurally temporary**. As 1&1 builds its own network (currently 25% coverage), these subscribers will gradually migrate off Vodafone's network over 3-5 years. Estimated at-risk revenue: **€100-200M/q** by 2028-2029.

## 3. Segment Deep Dives

### 3.1 Mobile — Stable Core, Churn Concern

| Metric | Value | 8Q Trend | vs Market |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Service revenue | €1,520M | 1,450 → 1,520 (**+4.8%**) | DT €2,555M (1.7x) |
| Total subs | 32,500K | 30,500 → 32,500 (**+6.6%**) | #3 (DT 52.2M, O2 45.9M) |
| Postpaid subs | 23,200K | — | 71.4% postpaid ratio |
| Prepaid subs | 6,300K | — | Legacy declining base |
| Net adds | +80K/q | — | DT +340K, O2 +170K |
| ARPU | €12.8 | 11.8 → 12.8 (**+8.5%**) | DT €14.2, O2 €10.8 |
| Churn | **1.05%/mo** | 1.15 → 1.05 (**improved**) | **Worst in market** (DT 0.80%) |
| IoT connections | 3,000K | — | Growth opportunity |

**Segment diagnosis**:
- **Positive**: ARPU trend is strong (+8.5% over 8Q), driven by postpaid mix improvement and price increases
- **Positive**: Churn has improved from 1.15% → 1.05%, but remains the highest in the market
- **Negative**: Net adds (+80K/q) are weak — only 24% of DT's and 47% of O2's
- **Risk**: The tariff analysis shows Vodafone's mobile pricing is "squeezed middle" — too expensive vs O2/1&1, not premium enough vs DT

**Management commentary**: *"Mobile service revenue Q3 +2.8% (Q2: +3.8%), growth decelerating. 1&1 migration complete, 12M users now on network. Consumer contract net adds +42K (Q2: +1K) — momentum improving."*

### 3.2 Fixed Broadband — The Critical Battleground

| Metric | Value | 8Q Trend | vs Market |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Service revenue | €795M | 820 → 795 (**-3.0%**) | DT €1,910M (2.4x) |
| Total subs | 9,940K | 10,320 → 9,940 (**-3.7%**) | #2 (DT 15,220K) |
| Cable subs | **6,980K** | 7,500 → 6,980 (**-6.9%**) | **Hemorrhaging** |
| Fiber subs | **1,480K** | 850 → 1,480 (**+74.1%**) | **Growth bright spot** |
| DSL subs | 1,480K | — | Legacy, stable |
| Net adds | **-63K/q** | — | **Only operator losing BB subs** |
| ARPU | €30.2 | 28.5 → 30.2 (**+6.0%**) | ARPU improving via upsell |

**The cable erosion crisis**:
- Cable subs declined from 7,500K → 6,980K over 8 quarters = **-520K lost** (-6.9%)
- This is driven by DT's fiber overbuild in cable footprint — fiber offers symmetric speeds and lower latency
- At current pace (-65K/quarter), cable base could drop below 6,000K by end of 2027

**The fiber growth story**:
- Fiber subs nearly doubled: 850K → 1,480K (+74.1%) over 8 quarters
- Vodafone-Altice FibreCo JV targets 7M FTTH homepasses in 6 years
- But DT already has 8,500K fiber homepasses — Vodafone is starting from behind

**Management commentary**: *"Broadband pricing strategy: January 2026 price increase, 'more-for-more' approach. New customer broadband ARPU at 3-year high (+21% YoY). Retail pricing actions from March-October 2025 are supporting ARPU trend."*

**Net assessment**: Revenue is declining (-1.1%) but ARPU is rising (+6.0%) — Vodafone is losing low-value subs while extracting more from remaining customers. This is a "managed decline" strategy, sustainable short-term but not a growth path.

### 3.3 B2B/Enterprise — The Growth Engine

| Metric | Value | 8Q Trend | vs Market |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue | **€520M** | 410 → 520 (**+26.8%**) | DT €1,230M (2.4x), O2 €500M |
| Growth | **+8.5% YoY** | — | DT +7.5%, O2 +13.0% |
| Customers | 215K | 185 → 215 (**+16.2%**) | DT 490K, O2 175K |
| Share of total revenue | **16.8%** | — | Growing share |

**Segment diagnosis**:
- **Strongest growth segment**: +26.8% over 8 quarters, consistent acceleration
- **Skaylink acquisition** (€175M, Dec 2025): Adds cloud, security, and managed services capabilities
- **Competitive position**: #2 behind DT (€1,230M) but growing faster. O2's B2B is growing at +13% from a similar base (€500M) — competitive pressure exists
- **Strategic importance**: B2B is less price-sensitive than consumer and offers higher margins. The "5-year €1B growth target" from new B2B head Hagen Rickmann is the key strategic commitment

**Management commentary**: *"B2B service revenue Q3 -1.8% (headline declining due to contract renewal ARPU pressure). Bright spot: digital services demand strong. Skaylink acquisition will accelerate cloud, security, and managed services."*

### 3.4 TV/Convergence — Legacy Asset, Convergence Vehicle

| Metric | Value | 8Q Trend | vs Market |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| TV revenue | €268M | 285 → 268 (**-6.0%**) | Declining |
| TV subs | **7,740K** | 8,120 → 7,740 (**-4.7%**) | **Market leader** (DT 4,380K) |
| TV net adds | **-6K/q** | — | Gradual decline |
| FMC subs | **4,900K** | 4,200 → 4,900 (**+16.7%**) | **Strong growth** |
| FMC penetration | **49.3%** | 40.7 → 49.3 (**+8.6pp**) | DT 51.9%, O2 47.9% |

**Dual narrative**:
- **TV standalone is declining**: Cable TV cord-cutting is structural. Streaming substitution (Netflix, Disney+) is permanent. TV subs will continue to erode
- **FMC is booming**: FMC subs grew +16.7% over 8 quarters (4,200K → 4,900K). FMC penetration approaching 50% — this is the retention engine

**Key insight**: TV's standalone value is diminishing, but its role as an FMC anchor is increasing. The strategic value of TV is not the €268M revenue — it's the churn reduction from bundling. FMC customers churn 30-40% less than mobile-only.

### 3.5 Wholesale — Temporary Windfall

| Metric | Value | 8Q Trend | Assessment |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Revenue | **€380M** | 180 → 380 (**+111%**) | 1&1 driven |
| Share of total | **12.3%** | 5.9% → 12.3% | Doubled |

Wholesale went from 5.9% to 12.3% of total revenue in 8 quarters. This is almost entirely driven by 1&1's national roaming agreement. Management confirms full run-rate reached in Q4.

**Strategic risk**: This revenue will decline as 1&1 builds own network coverage. At 25% coverage today, 1&1 may reach 50% by 2027-2028. Vodafone must plan for a **€100-200M quarterly revenue reduction** over the next 3-5 years.

## 4. Market Position Assessment

### 4.1 Position by Metric

| Dimension | Rank | Value | Gap to #1 |
|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Revenue | **#2** | €3,092M | DT 2.0x (€6,200M) |
| Revenue market share | **#2** | 25.1% | DT 50.3% |
| Mobile subscribers | **#3** | 32,500K | DT 1.6x, O2 1.4x |
| Mobile subscriber share | **#3** | 22.7% | DT dominates |
| Broadband subscribers | **#2** | 9,940K | DT 1.5x (15,220K) |
| Broadband share | **#1*** | 31.6% | **Leads on BB share** |
| TV subscribers | **#1** | 7,740K | 1.8x DT (4,380K) |

*Broadband share is #1 due to cable + DSL + fiber combined base vs DT's fiber-only count at household level.*

**Position summary**: Revenue #2 / Mobile #3 / Broadband #2 / TV #1. Vodafone's strength is in fixed infrastructure (cable broadband + TV), while mobile is the weakest relative position.

### 4.2 Share Trends — Direction of Travel

| Share Metric | Current | Direction |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Revenue share | 25.1% | Stable (DT gaining) |
| Mobile share | 22.7% | Slow growth |
| Broadband share | 31.6% | **Declining** (cable losses) |

**Critical signal**: Broadband share is the one moving in the wrong direction. Cable subscriber losses (-63K/q) are not being fully offset by fiber additions (+100K/q at current pace). If this trajectory continues, DT will overtake Vodafone on total broadband by ~2027.

## 5. Network Assessment

### 5.1 Network Infrastructure

| Asset | Status | vs Competitors |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **5G Coverage** | **92%** population | DT 97%, O2 98% — **lagging** |
| **4G Coverage** | **99.5%** | On par |
| **5G Base Stations** | **18,500** | DT 35,000 (1.9x), O2 20,000 |
| **Cable Homepass** | **~24,000K** | **Unique asset** — no competitor matches |
| **Fiber Homepass** | **1,500K** | DT 8,500K (5.7x) — **major gap** |
| **Edge Nodes** | **12** | DT 28 (2.3x) |
| **Virtualization** | **45%** | DT 70%, 1&1 100% — behind |

### 5.2 Technology Stack

| Component | Vodafone | Gap Analysis |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Mobile RAN Vendor | Ericsson + Nokia | Standard multi-vendor |
| 5G Type | **Non-standalone (NSA)** | DT has SA since Sep 2024; **VF behind** |
| 5G SA Status | Testing, planned 2026 | 12-18 months behind DT |
| Core Vendor | Ericsson | Standard |
| Spectrum Holdings | 220 MHz total | DT 275 MHz (+25%) |
| Core Network | Ericsson | DT uses Ericsson + Nokia (dual) |

### 5.3 Network Competitive Gap

**Three critical gaps**:

1. **5G coverage (92% vs 97-98%)**: Vodafone is now the third-best 5G network. O2 (historically weakest) has overtaken Vodafone at 98%. This undermines Vodafone's "quality network" positioning
2. **5G SA readiness**: DT launched commercial 5G Standalone in Sep 2024. Vodafone is still in testing, planned for 2026. SA enables network slicing, lower latency, and enterprise use cases — VF will be 12-18 months behind
3. **Fiber homepass (1,500K vs 8,500K)**: DT has 5.7x Vodafone's fiber footprint. The Altice JV (7M homes target) will take years to close this gap

**Unique advantage**: Cable network (~24M homepass) remains Vodafone's infrastructure differentiator. No competitor can match 250-1000 Mbps cable speeds at scale. DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade could extend cable's competitiveness against fiber.

## 8. Management Outlook & Guidance

### 8.1 Key Management Statements (Q3 FY26 Earnings)

| Topic | Commentary | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Germany EBITDA** | *"H2 better than H1, but FY26 will not return to positive growth. FY27 is when EBITDA growth turns positive."* | Investors must wait 12+ months for profitability improvement |
| **1&1 Wholesale** | *"Q4 reaches full run-rate. MDU base effect fades from Q3."* | Peak wholesale revenue — downside from here |
| **Broadband pricing** | *"January 2026 price increase, 'more-for-more' strategy. New customer ARPU at 3-year high (+21% YoY)."* | Extracting value from shrinking base |
| **Mobile** | *"Service revenue +2.8%, decelerating. Consumer contract net adds +42K, improving."* | Mixed signals — growth slowing but momentum improving |
| **B2B** | *"Service revenue -1.8% (headline). Digital services demand strong. Skaylink acquisition accelerates cloud/security."* | Near-term pressure, long-term pivot to digital services |
| **Group guidance** | *"FY26 EBITDAaL €11.3-11.6B reaffirmed. Dividend +2.5% YoY."* | Stable group, Germany is the laggard |

### 8.2 Strategic Direction — Reading Between the Lines

Management's actions reveal a clear strategic playbook:

1. **"Managed decline" in fixed broadband**: Price increases + ARPU focus, accepting subscriber losses. Not trying to win on volume against DT fiber
2. **"Invest in convergence"**: FMC penetration pushed from 41% → 49% in 8 quarters. This is the retention play
3. **"Bet on B2B"**: Skaylink acquisition + €1B 5-year growth target signals B2B as the future growth engine
4. **"Milk wholesale while it lasts"**: 1&1 wholesale at full run-rate; no public plan for the revenue decline
5. **"Stabilize mobile"**: Churn improvement (1.15→1.05) is progress, but far from DT's 0.80%

---

## 9. Strategic Diagnosis Summary

### 9.1 Health Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Trend | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Financial health | **7/10** | Improving | Margin expanding, revenue barely growing |
| Mobile business | **6/10** | Stable | ARPU up, but churn highest, net adds weakest |
| Fixed broadband | **4/10** | **Declining** | Cable erosion is the #1 strategic threat |
| B2B/Enterprise | **8/10** | **Growing** | Best growth segment; Skaylink boosts capabilities |
| TV/Convergence | **6/10** | Mixed | TV declining, FMC growing — net neutral |
| Wholesale | **7/10** | **Peak** | At full run-rate; structural decline ahead |
| Network position | **5/10** | **Slipping** | 5G #3, fiber gap widening, SA delayed |
| Competitive position | **5/10** | Pressured | "Squeezed middle" in pricing, churn, growth |

**Overall health rating: STABLE** — but "stable" masks diverging trajectories. B2B and wholesale are masking declines in fixed and competitive slippage in mobile.

### 9.2 Three Things That Must Change

| # | Issue | Current State | Target State | How |
|---|-------|--------------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | **Cable broadband erosion** | -63K/q, 6,980K cable subs declining | Stabilize at >6,500K by 2027 | DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade + aggressive FMC bundling + proactive retention in DT fiber areas |
| 2 | **Mobile churn** | 1.05% (worst in market) | <0.90% (match O2) | FMC cross-sell (raise from 49% → 60%), loyalty program, data rebalancing on GigaMobil S/M |
| 3 | **5G network position** | 92% (#3), no SA | 97%+ (#2), SA commercial | Accelerate 5G build to close gap with DT/O2; launch SA by mid-2026 for enterprise use cases |

### 9.3 Three Things Working Well

| # | Strength | Evidence | Action |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **B2B growth** | +8.5% YoY, Skaylink acquired | Double down — this is the highest-margin, least price-sensitive segment |
| 2 | **FMC penetration** | 40.7% → 49.3% in 8 quarters | Push to 60% — every FMC customer is a retained customer |
| 3 | **ARPU discipline** | Mobile ARPU +8.5%, BB ARPU +6.0% over 8Q | Continue "more-for-more" pricing; resist the urge to match O2 prices |
