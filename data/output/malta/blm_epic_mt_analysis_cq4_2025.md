## 3. "The Distant Third" — Central Diagnosis

The single most important finding across all Five Looks is Epic Mt's "Distant Third" positioning.

This is not a temporary market condition — it is a structural competitive problem that manifests in every dimension:


**The escape routes** (not mutually exclusive):
1. Leverage Digital Experience for Regulatory Environment
2. Leverage Price Competitiveness for Digital Strategy Alignment
3. Leverage Strong EBITDA margin at 30.0% for Epic Malta revenue growth 11.1% YoY

| Dimension | Epic Mt | Go Mt | Melita Mt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | €10M | €64M | €27M |
| Revenue Growth | +12.5% | +7.3% | +4.2% |

| Churn | 1.5% | 1.0% | 1.1% |
| 5G Coverage | 50.0% | 65.0% | 55.0% |

### Priority 4: Exploit Go Mt Weakness (STRATEGIC)

| Aspect | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| Addressable market | N/A |
| Approach | Competitor go_mt is weak in: Price Competitiveness: score 60 (market avg 71) |

---

## 5. What NOT to Do

Equally important — strategic traps to avoid:

| Trap | Why It's Tempting | Why It's Wrong |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enter a price war** | Value competitors are winning on price | Margin destruction without winning price-sensitive customers back |
| **Attempt premium repositioning** | Leader's margins are enviable | Trails leader on every dimension; would take years and heavy investment |
| **Delay core transformation** | Current performance is adequate | Key weakness: Brand Strength: score 55 (market avg 74); delay compounds disadvantage |

---

## 6. Timeline & Sequencing

**SHORT-TERM (6-18 months)**
  - Close Brand Strength Gap
  - Close Customer Service Gap
  - Close Distribution Gap

**MEDIUM-TERM (2-3 years)**
  - Exploit Go Mt Weakness


---

## 7. Risk/Reward Summary

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Execute priorities | +10-16% over 5 years | Investment required | Positive net value |
| Do nothing | -6-12% over 5 years | €0 | Structural decline |

**The asymmetry is clear**: the downside of inaction exceeds the net cost of action.

**Implications**:
- OTT services continue to erode traditional voice/SMS revenue; operators must pivot toward data, connectivity, and digital services.
- Streaming substitution pressures TV/IPTV bundling strategies; operators should focus on aggregation and super-bundling.

### Supplier Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network equipment vendor concentration | Oligopoly of 3 major vendors (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia). Limited alternatives increase supplier leverage on pricing and technology roadmaps. | high | stable |
| Semiconductor supply chain | Chip supply constraints can create bottlenecks for both network equipment and consumer devices. | medium | stable |
| Tower infrastructure | Independent tower companies (e.g., Vantage Towers, GD Towers) have pricing power for site rentals and co-location. | medium | increasing |
| Fiber infrastructure suppliers | Fiber cable and deployment contractors influence capex for FTTH rollout programs. | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Vendor oligopoly limits negotiation leverage; multi-vendor strategies and Open RAN initiatives can help diversify supply.
- Tower company independence increases site rental costs; operators should evaluate infrastructure-sharing arrangements.

### Buyer Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consumer churn rates | Average mobile churn: 1.20%/month. Highest: 1.50% indicating moderate willingness to switch. | medium | stable |
| Postpaid contract mix | Average postpaid ratio: 66%. Moderate contract lock-in moderately constrains buyer mobility. | medium | stable |
| Individual consumer bargaining power | Individual consumers have low bargaining power, but low switching costs (number portability, short contracts) mean they vote with their feet. | medium | increasing |
| Enterprise customer concentration | Large enterprise customers have significant bargaining power through multi-vendor strategies and competitive tenders. | high | stable |
| Regulatory protection for buyers | EU regulations support number portability, contract transparency, and maximum contract lengths, enhancing consumer switching ability. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- Enterprise customers can leverage multi-vendor strategies; differentiation through service quality and SLAs is critical.
- Low switching costs and regulatory support for portability mean operators must compete on value, not lock-in.

<!-- MODULE: 06 — Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution
> **Diagnosis**: The Distant Third
> **Posture**: Cautious
> **Direction**: As The Distant Third: differentiate and grow through focused investment in competitive advantages

### Decision 1: Define Strategy
As The Distant Third: differentiate and grow through focused investment in competitive advantages

| Priority | Pillar | Direction | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Growth Strategy | Focused growth in high-momentum segments: Mobile | Grow Mobile above market rate; Improve segment profitability |
| P0 | Competitive Strategy | Differentiate on quality and innovation to justify premium positioning | Improve NPS by 5 points; Launch 2+ differentiating services |
| P1 | Transformation Strategy | 5G-first network modernization — quality leadership | 5G population coverage 80%+; 5G revenue contribution 15%+ |
| P1 | Customer Strategy | Optimize value extraction in stable segments: Fixed Broadband, B2B | Upsell rate +10% in Fixed Broadband, B2B; Cross-sell convergence bundles |

### Decision 2: Define Key Tasks
Resource allocation: 1 P0 (immediate), 2 P1 (1-2 years), 1 P2 (3-5 years)

| Priority | Domain | Task | Description | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Mobile Growth | Mobile at €7M showing strong momentum — invest to scale | Mobile revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P1 | Network | 5G Coverage Expansion | Expand 5G population coverage to strengthen mobile competiti | 5G pop coverage target; 5G attach rate |
| P1 | Customer | Customer Experience Enhancement | Improve digital touchpoints and service resolution to boost  | NPS +5 points; First-call resolution rate 80%+ |
| P2 | Efficiency | Operational Efficiency & Automation | EBITDA margin 30.0% — maintain through smart automation and  | Process automation 30%+; Cost-to-serve reduction |

### Decision 3: Define Execution
#### Quarterly Roadmap
**Q1: Foundation & Quick Wins** (P0)
  - Launch: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Establish governance cadence
  - Baseline KPI measurement

**Q2: Scale & Build Capabilities** (P0)
  - Scale: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Initiate: 5G Coverage Expansion
  - Initiate: Customer Experience Enhancement

**Q3: Optimize & Iterate** (P1)
  - Mid-year review and course correction
  - Optimize P0 initiatives based on Q1-Q2 data
  - Expand P1 initiatives to full scale

**Q4: Assess & Plan Next Year** (P1)
  - Year-end results assessment
  - Lessons learned documentation
  - Next-year strategy refresh based on outcomes

#### Governance
- **Monthly Progress Review** (Monthly): Track P0 task progress, KPI trends, and resource utilization
- **Quarterly Strategic Checkpoint** (Quarterly): Evaluate strategy execution, adjust priorities, reallocate resources
- **Mid-Year Strategic Adjustment** (Semi-annual): Major review of market conditions and strategy effectiveness

#### Strategic Traps to Avoid
- **Enter a price war**: Value competitors are winning on price — Reality: Margin destruction without winning price-sensitive customers back
- **Attempt premium repositioning**: Leader's margins are enviable — Reality: Trails leader on every dimension; would take years and heavy investment
- **Delay core transformation**: Current performance is adequate — Reality: Key weakness: Brand Strength: score 55 (market avg 74); delay compounds disadvantage

#### Key Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Resource constraints delay P0 initiatives | Medium | Ring-fence P0 budgets; establish escalation path for blockers |
| Macro-economic slowdown reduces consumer spending | Low-Medium | Prepare value-tier offerings; shift mix toward B2B resilience |

#### Strategic Narrative
As The Distant Third, the strategic posture is Cautious. As The Distant Third: differentiate and grow through focused investment in competitive advantages. Execution focuses on 1 P0-priority tasks out of 4 across Business, Customer, Efficiency, Network, with quarterly milestones and monthly governance checkpoints.
