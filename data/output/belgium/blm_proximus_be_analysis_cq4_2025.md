| Growth rate disparity | Service revenue growth ranges from -3.2% to +0.9% (spread: 4.1pp) | medium | stable |
| Margin pressure | Average EBITDA margin: 36.4% | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Market is concentrated with top player at 50% revenue share.

### Threat of New Entrants

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Entry barriers | High barriers: spectrum licensing, massive capex for network build, regulatory approvals, established brand loyalty | high | stable |

**Implications**:
- High entry barriers (spectrum, capex, regulation) limit new competitors, but determined entrants with deep pockets can still disrupt.

### Threat of Substitutes

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice | WhatsApp, Signal, Teams replacing traditional voice/SMS revenue. OTT messaging penetration continues to grow. | high | increasing |
| Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV | Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Premium substituting traditional TV/cable TV subscriptions. | medium | increasing |
| Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency | Public and private Wi-Fi networks reduce reliance on mobile data, especially in urban areas. | low | stable |
| Cloud services substitute enterprise ICT | AWS, Azure, GCP offering direct enterprise connectivity, reducing operator B2B ICT revenue opportunity. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- OTT services continue to erode traditional voice/SMS revenue; operators must pivot toward data, connectivity, and digital services.
- Streaming substitution pressures TV/IPTV bundling strategies; operators should focus on aggregation and super-bundling.

### Supplier Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network equipment vendor concentration | Oligopoly of 3 major vendors (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia). Limited alternatives increase supplier leverage on pricing and technology roadmaps. | high | stable |
| Semiconductor supply chain | Chip supply constraints can create bottlenecks for both network equipment and consumer devices. | medium | stable |
| Tower infrastructure | Independent tower companies (e.g., Vantage Towers, GD Towers) have pricing power for site rentals and co-location. | medium | increasing |
| Fiber infrastructure suppliers | Fiber cable and deployment contractors influence capex for FTTH rollout programs. | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Vendor oligopoly limits negotiation leverage; multi-vendor strategies and Open RAN initiatives can help diversify supply.
- Tower company independence increases site rental costs; operators should evaluate infrastructure-sharing arrangements.

### Buyer Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consumer churn rates | Average mobile churn: 1.37%/month. Highest: 1.50% indicating moderate willingness to switch. | medium | stable |
| Postpaid contract mix | Average postpaid ratio: 95%. High contract lock-in reduces buyer mobility. | low | stable |
| Individual consumer bargaining power | Individual consumers have low bargaining power, but low switching costs (number portability, short contracts) mean they vote with their feet. | medium | increasing |
| Enterprise customer concentration | Large enterprise customers have significant bargaining power through multi-vendor strategies and competitive tenders. | high | stable |
| Regulatory protection for buyers | EU regulations support number portability, contract transparency, and maximum contract lengths, enhancing consumer switching ability. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- Enterprise customers can leverage multi-vendor strategies; differentiation through service quality and SLAs is critical.
- Low switching costs and regulatory support for portability mean operators must compete on value, not lock-in.

<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution
> **Diagnosis**: The Dominant Leader
> **Posture**: Defensive
> **Direction**: As The Dominant Leader: defend leadership through innovation and ecosystem lock-in

### Decision 1: Define Strategy
As The Dominant Leader: defend leadership through innovation and ecosystem lock-in

| Priority | Pillar | Direction | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Growth Strategy | Defend leadership through ecosystem expansion in Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B | Maintain #1 revenue share; Grow Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B by 5-8% YoY |
