## 2. Five Forces Analysis

| Force | Level | Key Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Existing Competitors | **High** | Number of competitors; Market concentration; Growth rate disparity |
| Threat of New Entrants | **Medium** | Active new entrant: WOM Colombia; Entry barriers |
| Threat of Substitutes | **High** | OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice; Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV; Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency |
| Supplier Bargaining Power | **Medium** | Network equipment vendor concentration; Semiconductor supply chain; Tower infrastructure |

### Existing Competitors

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Number of competitors | 4 active operators in the market | high | stable |
| Market concentration | Top operator holds 49% of market revenue (total: COP 9,340M) | high | stable |
| Growth rate disparity | Service revenue growth ranges from +2.3% to +35.3% (spread: 33.0pp) | high | increasing |
| Margin pressure | Average EBITDA margin: 25.7% | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Market is concentrated with top player at 49% revenue share.

### Threat of New Entrants

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Active new entrant: WOM Colombia | WOM Colombia is currently building/expanding its network presence | medium | increasing |
| Entry barriers | High barriers: spectrum licensing, massive capex for network build, regulatory approvals, established brand loyalty | high | stable |

**Implications**:
- WOM Colombia entering the market may increase competitive pressure on pricing and coverage.
- High entry barriers (spectrum, capex, regulation) limit new competitors, but determined entrants with deep pockets can still disrupt.

### Threat of Substitutes

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice | WhatsApp, Signal, Teams replacing traditional voice/SMS revenue. OTT messaging penetration continues to grow. | high | increasing |
| Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV | Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Premium substituting traditional TV/cable TV subscriptions. | medium | increasing |
| Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency | Public and private Wi-Fi networks reduce reliance on mobile data, especially in urban areas. | low | stable |
| Cloud services substitute enterprise ICT | AWS, Azure, GCP offering direct enterprise connectivity, reducing operator B2B ICT revenue opportunity. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- OTT services continue to erode traditional voice/SMS revenue; operators must pivot toward data, connectivity, and digital services.
- Streaming substitution pressures TV/IPTV bundling strategies; operators should focus on aggregation and super-bundling.

### Supplier Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network equipment vendor concentration | Oligopoly of 3 major vendors (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia). Limited alternatives increase supplier leverage on pricing and technology roadmaps. | high | stable |
| Semiconductor supply chain | Chip supply constraints can create bottlenecks for both network equipment and consumer devices. | medium | stable |
| Tower infrastructure | Independent tower companies (e.g., Vantage Towers, GD Towers) have pricing power for site rentals and co-location. | medium | increasing |
| Fiber infrastructure suppliers | Fiber cable and deployment contractors influence capex for FTTH rollout programs. | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Vendor oligopoly limits negotiation leverage; multi-vendor strategies and Open RAN initiatives can help diversify supply.
- Tower company independence increases site rental costs; operators should evaluate infrastructure-sharing arrangements.

### Buyer Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consumer churn rates | Average mobile churn: 2.38%/month. Highest: 3.00% indicating high willingness to switch. | high | stable |
| Postpaid contract mix | Average postpaid ratio: 29%. Moderate contract lock-in moderately constrains buyer mobility. | medium | stable |
| Individual consumer bargaining power | Individual consumers have low bargaining power, but low switching costs (number portability, short contracts) mean they vote with their feet. | medium | increasing |
| Enterprise customer concentration | Large enterprise customers have significant bargaining power through multi-vendor strategies and competitive tenders. | high | stable |
| Regulatory protection for buyers | EU regulations support number portability, contract transparency, and maximum contract lengths, enhancing consumer switching ability. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- Enterprise customers can leverage multi-vendor strategies; differentiation through service quality and SLAs is critical.
- Low switching costs and regulatory support for portability mean operators must compete on value, not lock-in.

<!-- MODULE: 06 — Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution
> **Diagnosis**: The Squeezed Middle
> **Posture**: Defensive
> **Direction**: As The Squeezed Middle: stabilize core business, then selectively invest for turnaround

### Decision 1: Define Strategy
As The Squeezed Middle: stabilize core business, then selectively invest for turnaround

| Priority | Pillar | Direction | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Growth Strategy | Close the gap to market leader — accelerate Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B | Gain 1-2pp revenue share; Grow Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B double-digit |
| P0 | Competitive Strategy | Shore up competitive position — address: Price Competitiveness: score 70 (market avg 73) | Close Price Competitiveness: score 70 (market avg 73) gap within 12 months; Reduce customer churn |
| P1 | Transformation Strategy | Accelerate fiber transition — converged network as competitive moat | Fiber homepass coverage +20%; FMC bundle attach rate 50%+ |
| P1 | Customer Strategy | Optimize value extraction in stable segments: Wholesale | Upsell rate +10% in Wholesale; Cross-sell convergence bundles |

### Decision 2: Define Key Tasks
Resource allocation: 3 P0 (immediate), 3 P1 (1-2 years), 1 P2 (3-5 years)

| Priority | Domain | Task | Description | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Network | Accelerate Fixed Network Upgrade | Drive DOCSIS/Fiber rollout to increase homepass and improve  | Homepass coverage +15%; Speed tier upgrades |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Mobile Growth | Mobile at €1,240M showing strong momentum — invest to scale | Mobile revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth | Fixed Broadband at €880M showing strong momentum — invest to | Fixed Broadband revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P1 | Network | 5G Coverage Expansion | Expand 5G population coverage to strengthen mobile competiti | 5G pop coverage target; 5G attach rate |
| P1 | Business | Opportunity Portfolio Execution | 15 grow/invest opportunities identified — establish executio | Launch 3+ priority initiatives; Pipeline contribution tracking |
| P1 | Customer | Customer Experience Enhancement | Improve digital touchpoints and service resolution to boost  | NPS +5 points; First-call resolution rate 80%+ |
| P2 | Efficiency | Operational Efficiency & Automation | EBITDA margin 35.1% — maintain through smart automation and  | Process automation 30%+; Cost-to-serve reduction |

### Decision 3: Define Execution
#### Quarterly Roadmap
**Q1: Foundation & Quick Wins** (P0)
  - Launch: Accelerate Fixed Network Upgrade
  - Launch: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Launch: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Establish governance cadence
  - Baseline KPI measurement

**Q2: Scale & Build Capabilities** (P0)
  - Scale: Accelerate Fixed Network Upgrade
  - Scale: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Scale: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Initiate: 5G Coverage Expansion
  - Initiate: Opportunity Portfolio Execution

**Q3: Optimize & Iterate** (P1)
  - Mid-year review and course correction
  - Optimize P0 initiatives based on Q1-Q2 data
  - Expand P1 initiatives to full scale

**Q4: Assess & Plan Next Year** (P1)
  - Year-end results assessment
  - Lessons learned documentation
  - Next-year strategy refresh based on outcomes

#### Governance
- **Monthly Progress Review** (Monthly): Track P0 task progress, KPI trends, and resource utilization
- **Quarterly Strategic Checkpoint** (Quarterly): Evaluate strategy execution, adjust priorities, reallocate resources
- **Mid-Year Strategic Adjustment** (Semi-annual): Major review of market conditions and strategy effectiveness

#### Strategic Traps to Avoid
- **Enter a price war**: Value competitors are winning on price — Reality: Margin destruction without winning price-sensitive customers back
- **Attempt premium repositioning**: Leader's margins are enviable — Reality: Trails leader on every dimension; would take years and heavy investment
- **Delay core transformation**: Current performance is adequate — Reality: Key weakness: Price Competitiveness: score 70 (market avg 73); delay compounds disadvantage

#### Key Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Resource constraints delay P0 initiatives | Medium | Ring-fence P0 budgets; establish escalation path for blockers |
| Macro-economic slowdown reduces consumer spending | Low-Medium | Prepare value-tier offerings; shift mix toward B2B resilience |

#### Strategic Narrative
As The Squeezed Middle, the strategic posture is Defensive. As The Squeezed Middle: stabilize core business, then selectively invest for turnaround. Execution focuses on 3 P0-priority tasks out of 7 across Business, Customer, Efficiency, Network, with quarterly milestones and monthly governance checkpoints.
