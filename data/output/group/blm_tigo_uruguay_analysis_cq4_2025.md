<!-- MODULE: 06 — Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution
> **Diagnosis**: The Distant Third
> **Posture**: Turnaround
> **Direction**: As The Distant Third: stabilize core business, then selectively invest for turnaround

### Decision 1: Define Strategy
As The Distant Third: stabilize core business, then selectively invest for turnaround

| Priority | Pillar | Direction | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Growth Strategy | Focused growth in high-momentum segments: Mobile, Fixed Broadband | Grow Mobile, Fixed Broadband above market rate; Improve segment profitability |
| P0 | Competitive Strategy | Shore up competitive position — address: Brand Strength: score 45 (market avg 68) | Close Brand Strength: score 45 (market avg 68) gap within 12 months; Reduce customer churn |
| P1 | Transformation Strategy | 5G-first network modernization — quality leadership | 5G population coverage 80%+; 5G revenue contribution 15%+ |
| P1 | Customer Strategy | Optimize value extraction in stable segments: B2B, TV/Convergence | Upsell rate +10% in B2B, TV/Convergence; Cross-sell convergence bundles |

### Decision 2: Define Key Tasks
Resource allocation: 2 P0 (immediate), 2 P1 (1-2 years), 1 P2 (3-5 years)

| Priority | Domain | Task | Description | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Mobile Growth | Mobile at €1,775M showing strong momentum — invest to scale | Mobile revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth | Fixed Broadband at €85M showing strong momentum — invest to  | Fixed Broadband revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P1 | Network | 5G Coverage Expansion | Expand 5G population coverage to strengthen mobile competiti | 5G pop coverage target; 5G attach rate |
| P1 | Customer | Customer Experience Enhancement | Improve digital touchpoints and service resolution to boost  | NPS +5 points; First-call resolution rate 80%+ |
| P2 | Efficiency | Operational Efficiency & Automation | EBITDA margin 30.0% — maintain through smart automation and  | Process automation 30%+; Cost-to-serve reduction |

### Decision 3: Define Execution
#### Quarterly Roadmap
**Q1: Foundation & Quick Wins** (P0)
  - Launch: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Launch: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Establish governance cadence
  - Baseline KPI measurement

**Q2: Scale & Build Capabilities** (P0)
  - Scale: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Scale: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Initiate: 5G Coverage Expansion
  - Initiate: Customer Experience Enhancement

**Q3: Optimize & Iterate** (P1)
  - Mid-year review and course correction
  - Optimize P0 initiatives based on Q1-Q2 data
  - Expand P1 initiatives to full scale

**Q4: Assess & Plan Next Year** (P1)
  - Year-end results assessment
  - Lessons learned documentation
  - Next-year strategy refresh based on outcomes

#### Governance
- **Monthly Progress Review** (Monthly): Track P0 task progress, KPI trends, and resource utilization
- **Quarterly Strategic Checkpoint** (Quarterly): Evaluate strategy execution, adjust priorities, reallocate resources
- **Mid-Year Strategic Adjustment** (Semi-annual): Major review of market conditions and strategy effectiveness

#### Strategic Traps to Avoid
- **Enter a price war**: Value competitors are winning on price — Reality: Margin destruction without winning price-sensitive customers back
- **Attempt premium repositioning**: Leader's margins are enviable — Reality: Trails leader on every dimension; would take years and heavy investment
- **Delay core transformation**: Current performance is adequate — Reality: Key weakness: Brand Strength: score 45 (market avg 68); delay compounds disadvantage

#### Key Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Resource constraints delay P0 initiatives | Medium | Ring-fence P0 budgets; establish escalation path for blockers |
| Macro-economic slowdown reduces consumer spending | Low-Medium | Prepare value-tier offerings; shift mix toward B2B resilience |

#### Strategic Narrative
As The Distant Third, the strategic posture is Turnaround. As The Distant Third: stabilize core business, then selectively invest for turnaround. Execution focuses on 2 P0-priority tasks out of 5 across Business, Customer, Efficiency, Network, with quarterly milestones and monthly governance checkpoints.
