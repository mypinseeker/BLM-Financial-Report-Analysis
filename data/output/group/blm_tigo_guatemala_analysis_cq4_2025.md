| Fiber infrastructure suppliers | Fiber cable and deployment contractors influence capex for FTTH rollout programs. | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Vendor oligopoly limits negotiation leverage; multi-vendor strategies and Open RAN initiatives can help diversify supply.
- Tower company independence increases site rental costs; operators should evaluate infrastructure-sharing arrangements.

### Buyer Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consumer churn rates | Average mobile churn: 2.90%/month. Highest: 3.80% indicating high willingness to switch. | high | stable |
| Postpaid contract mix | Average postpaid ratio: 16%. Moderate contract lock-in moderately constrains buyer mobility. | medium | stable |
| Individual consumer bargaining power | Individual consumers have low bargaining power, but low switching costs (number portability, short contracts) mean they vote with their feet. | medium | increasing |
| Enterprise customer concentration | Large enterprise customers have significant bargaining power through multi-vendor strategies and competitive tenders. | high | stable |
| Regulatory protection for buyers | EU regulations support number portability, contract transparency, and maximum contract lengths, enhancing consumer switching ability. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- Enterprise customers can leverage multi-vendor strategies; differentiation through service quality and SLAs is critical.
- Low switching costs and regulatory support for portability mean operators must compete on value, not lock-in.

<!-- MODULE: 06 — Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution
> **Diagnosis**: The Dominant Leader
> **Posture**: Offensive
> **Direction**: As The Dominant Leader: defend leadership through innovation and ecosystem lock-in

### Decision 1: Define Strategy
As The Dominant Leader: defend leadership through innovation and ecosystem lock-in

| Priority | Pillar | Direction | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Growth Strategy | Defend leadership through ecosystem expansion in Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B | Maintain #1 revenue share; Grow Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B by 5-8% YoY |
| P0 | Competitive Strategy | Capitalize on competitive strengths to gain market share | Outgrow competitors in key segments; Increase service differentiation |
| P1 | Transformation Strategy | Accelerate fiber transition — converged network as competitive moat | Fiber homepass coverage +20%; FMC bundle attach rate 50%+ |
| P1 | Customer Strategy | Optimize value extraction in stable segments: Wholesale | Upsell rate +10% in Wholesale; Cross-sell convergence bundles |

### Decision 2: Define Key Tasks
Resource allocation: 2 P0 (immediate), 3 P1 (1-2 years), 1 P2 (3-5 years)

| Priority | Domain | Task | Description | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Mobile Growth | Mobile at €2,900M showing strong momentum — invest to scale | Mobile revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth | Fixed Broadband at €980M showing strong momentum — invest to | Fixed Broadband revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P1 | Network | Network Quality Optimization | Improve network reliability and customer experience scores | Network quality index improvement |
| P1 | Business | Opportunity Portfolio Execution | 14 grow/invest opportunities identified — establish executio | Launch 3+ priority initiatives; Pipeline contribution tracking |
| P1 | Customer | Customer Experience Enhancement | Improve digital touchpoints and service resolution to boost  | NPS +5 points; First-call resolution rate 80%+ |
| P2 | Efficiency | Operational Efficiency & Automation | EBITDA margin 45.1% — maintain through smart automation and  | Process automation 30%+; Cost-to-serve reduction |

### Decision 3: Define Execution
#### Quarterly Roadmap
**Q1: Foundation & Quick Wins** (P0)
  - Launch: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Launch: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Establish governance cadence
  - Baseline KPI measurement

**Q2: Scale & Build Capabilities** (P0)
  - Scale: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Scale: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Initiate: Network Quality Optimization
  - Initiate: Opportunity Portfolio Execution

**Q3: Optimize & Iterate** (P1)
  - Mid-year review and course correction
  - Optimize P0 initiatives based on Q1-Q2 data
  - Expand P1 initiatives to full scale
