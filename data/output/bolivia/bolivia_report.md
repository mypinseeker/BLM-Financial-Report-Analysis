## 1. Market Structure Overview

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Number of operators | 3 |
| Market structure | 3-operator oligopoly |
| Competition intensity | **Medium** |
| Target position | #1 by revenue |

The market comprises 3 active operators: Viva Bolivia, Entel Bolivia, Tigo Bolivia. Overall competition intensity is assessed as medium. Revenue ranking: Tigo Bolivia (1,890M), Entel Bolivia (1,420M), Viva Bolivia (502.0M). Five Forces: Existing Competitors: high; New Entrants: low; Substitutes: high; Supplier Power: medium; Buyer Power: high.

---

## 2. Five Forces Analysis

| Force | Level | Key Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Existing Competitors | **High** | Number of competitors; Market concentration; Growth rate disparity |
| Threat of New Entrants | **Low** | Entry barriers |
| Threat of Substitutes | **High** | OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice; Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV; Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency |
| Supplier Bargaining Power | **Medium** | Network equipment vendor concentration; Semiconductor supply chain; Tower infrastructure |
| Buyer Bargaining Power | **High** | Consumer churn rates; Postpaid contract mix; Individual consumer bargaining power |

### Existing Competitors

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Number of competitors | 3 active operators in the market | medium | stable |
| Market concentration | Top operator holds 50% of market revenue (total: BOB 3,812M) | high | stable |
| Growth rate disparity | Service revenue growth ranges from -2.1% to +7.1% (spread: 9.2pp) | high | increasing |
| Margin pressure | Average EBITDA margin: 31.9% | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Market is concentrated with top player at 50% revenue share.

### Threat of New Entrants

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Entry barriers | High barriers: spectrum licensing, massive capex for network build, regulatory approvals, established brand loyalty | high | stable |

**Implications**:
- High entry barriers (spectrum, capex, regulation) limit new competitors, but determined entrants with deep pockets can still disrupt.

### Threat of Substitutes

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice | WhatsApp, Signal, Teams replacing traditional voice/SMS revenue. OTT messaging penetration continues to grow. | high | increasing |
| Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV | Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Premium substituting traditional TV/cable TV subscriptions. | medium | increasing |
| Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency | Public and private Wi-Fi networks reduce reliance on mobile data, especially in urban areas. | low | stable |
| Cloud services substitute enterprise ICT | AWS, Azure, GCP offering direct enterprise connectivity, reducing operator B2B ICT revenue opportunity. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- OTT services continue to erode traditional voice/SMS revenue; operators must pivot toward data, connectivity, and digital services.
- Streaming substitution pressures TV/IPTV bundling strategies; operators should focus on aggregation and super-bundling.

### Supplier Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network equipment vendor concentration | Oligopoly of 3 major vendors (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia). Limited alternatives increase supplier leverage on pricing and technology roadmaps. | high | stable |
| Semiconductor supply chain | Chip supply constraints can create bottlenecks for both network equipment and consumer devices. | medium | stable |
| Tower infrastructure | Independent tower companies (e.g., Vantage Towers, GD Towers) have pricing power for site rentals and co-location. | medium | increasing |
| Fiber infrastructure suppliers | Fiber cable and deployment contractors influence capex for FTTH rollout programs. | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Vendor oligopoly limits negotiation leverage; multi-vendor strategies and Open RAN initiatives can help diversify supply.
- Tower company independence increases site rental costs; operators should evaluate infrastructure-sharing arrangements.

### Buyer Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consumer churn rates | Average mobile churn: 3.10%/month. Highest: 4.20% indicating high willingness to switch. | high | stable |
| Postpaid contract mix | Average postpaid ratio: 10%. Moderate contract lock-in moderately constrains buyer mobility. | medium | stable |
| Individual consumer bargaining power | Individual consumers have low bargaining power, but low switching costs (number portability, short contracts) mean they vote with their feet. | medium | increasing |
| Enterprise customer concentration | Large enterprise customers have significant bargaining power through multi-vendor strategies and competitive tenders. | high | stable |
| Regulatory protection for buyers | EU regulations support number portability, contract transparency, and maximum contract lengths, enhancing consumer switching ability. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- Enterprise customers can leverage multi-vendor strategies; differentiation through service quality and SLAs is critical.
- Low switching costs and regulatory support for portability mean operators must compete on value, not lock-in.

<!-- MODULE: 06 — Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->


## Three Decisions — Strategy & Execution
> **Diagnosis**: The Dominant Leader
> **Posture**: Offensive
> **Direction**: As The Dominant Leader: defend leadership through innovation and ecosystem lock-in

### Decision 1: Define Strategy
As The Dominant Leader: defend leadership through innovation and ecosystem lock-in

| Priority | Pillar | Direction | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Growth Strategy | Defend leadership through ecosystem expansion in Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B | Maintain #1 revenue share; Grow Mobile, Fixed Broadband, B2B by 5-8% YoY |
| P0 | Competitive Strategy | Capitalize on competitive strengths to gain market share | Outgrow competitors in key segments; Increase service differentiation |
| P1 | Transformation Strategy | Accelerate fiber transition — converged network as competitive moat | Fiber homepass coverage +20%; FMC bundle attach rate 50%+ |
| P1 | Customer Strategy | Optimize value extraction in stable segments: Wholesale | Upsell rate +10% in Wholesale; Cross-sell convergence bundles |

### Decision 2: Define Key Tasks
Resource allocation: 3 P0 (immediate), 2 P1 (1-2 years), 1 P2 (3-5 years)

| Priority | Domain | Task | Description | KPIs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P0 | Network | Accelerate Fixed Network Upgrade | Drive DOCSIS/Fiber rollout to increase homepass and improve  | Homepass coverage +15%; Speed tier upgrades |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Mobile Growth | Mobile at €1,340M showing strong momentum — invest to scale | Mobile revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P0 | Business | Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth | Fixed Broadband at €350M showing strong momentum — invest to | Fixed Broadband revenue +10% YoY; Market share gain |
| P1 | Business | Opportunity Portfolio Execution | 13 grow/invest opportunities identified — establish executio | Launch 3+ priority initiatives; Pipeline contribution tracking |
| P1 | Customer | Customer Experience Enhancement | Improve digital touchpoints and service resolution to boost  | NPS +5 points; First-call resolution rate 80%+ |
| P2 | Efficiency | Operational Efficiency & Automation | EBITDA margin 42.6% — maintain through smart automation and  | Process automation 30%+; Cost-to-serve reduction |

### Decision 3: Define Execution
#### Quarterly Roadmap
