## 2. Five Forces Analysis

| Force | Level | Key Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Existing Competitors | **High** | Number of competitors; Market concentration; Growth rate disparity |
| Threat of New Entrants | **Low** | Entry barriers |
| Threat of Substitutes | **High** | OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice; Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV; Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency |
| Supplier Bargaining Power | **Medium** | Network equipment vendor concentration; Semiconductor supply chain; Tower infrastructure |
| Buyer Bargaining Power | **Medium** | Consumer churn rates; Postpaid contract mix; Individual consumer bargaining power |

### Existing Competitors

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Number of competitors | 3 active operators in the market | medium | stable |
| Market concentration | Top operator holds 48% of market revenue (total: EUR 3,055M) | high | stable |
| Growth rate disparity | Service revenue growth ranges from -1.7% to +4.0% (spread: 5.7pp) | high | increasing |
| Margin pressure | Average EBITDA margin: 43.3% | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Market is concentrated with top player at 48% revenue share.

### Threat of New Entrants

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Entry barriers | High barriers: spectrum licensing, massive capex for network build, regulatory approvals, established brand loyalty | high | stable |

**Implications**:
- High entry barriers (spectrum, capex, regulation) limit new competitors, but determined entrants with deep pockets can still disrupt.

### Threat of Substitutes

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OTT messaging replaces SMS/voice | WhatsApp, Signal, Teams replacing traditional voice/SMS revenue. OTT messaging penetration continues to grow. | high | increasing |
| Streaming replaces linear TV/IPTV | Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Premium substituting traditional TV/cable TV subscriptions. | medium | increasing |
| Wi-Fi offload reduces cellular dependency | Public and private Wi-Fi networks reduce reliance on mobile data, especially in urban areas. | low | stable |
| Cloud services substitute enterprise ICT | AWS, Azure, GCP offering direct enterprise connectivity, reducing operator B2B ICT revenue opportunity. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- OTT services continue to erode traditional voice/SMS revenue; operators must pivot toward data, connectivity, and digital services.
- Streaming substitution pressures TV/IPTV bundling strategies; operators should focus on aggregation and super-bundling.

### Supplier Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network equipment vendor concentration | Oligopoly of 3 major vendors (Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia). Limited alternatives increase supplier leverage on pricing and technology roadmaps. | high | stable |
| Semiconductor supply chain | Chip supply constraints can create bottlenecks for both network equipment and consumer devices. | medium | stable |
| Tower infrastructure | Independent tower companies (e.g., Vantage Towers, GD Towers) have pricing power for site rentals and co-location. | medium | increasing |
| Fiber infrastructure suppliers | Fiber cable and deployment contractors influence capex for FTTH rollout programs. | medium | stable |

**Implications**:
- Vendor oligopoly limits negotiation leverage; multi-vendor strategies and Open RAN initiatives can help diversify supply.
- Tower company independence increases site rental costs; operators should evaluate infrastructure-sharing arrangements.

### Buyer Bargaining Power

| Factor | Description | Impact | Trend |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consumer churn rates | Average mobile churn: 1.00%/month. Highest: 1.10% indicating moderate willingness to switch. | medium | stable |
| Postpaid contract mix | Average postpaid ratio: 90%. High contract lock-in reduces buyer mobility. | low | stable |
| Individual consumer bargaining power | Individual consumers have low bargaining power, but low switching costs (number portability, short contracts) mean they vote with their feet. | medium | increasing |
| Enterprise customer concentration | Large enterprise customers have significant bargaining power through multi-vendor strategies and competitive tenders. | high | stable |
| Regulatory protection for buyers | EU regulations support number portability, contract transparency, and maximum contract lengths, enhancing consumer switching ability. | medium | increasing |

**Implications**:
- Enterprise customers can leverage multi-vendor strategies; differentiation through service quality and SLAs is critical.
- Low switching costs and regulatory support for portability mean operators must compete on value, not lock-in.

#### Quarterly Roadmap
**Q1: Foundation & Quick Wins** (P0)
  - Launch: Accelerate Fixed Network Upgrade
  - Launch: Accelerate Mobile Growth
  - Launch: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Establish governance cadence
  - Baseline KPI measurement

**Q2: Scale & Build Capabilities** (P0)
  - Scale: Accelerate Fixed Network Upgrade

  - Scale: Accelerate Fixed Broadband Growth
  - Initiate: 5G Coverage Expansion
  - Initiate: Opportunity Portfolio Execution

**Q3: Optimize & Iterate** (P1)
  - Mid-year review and course correction
  - Optimize P0 initiatives based on Q1-Q2 data
  - Expand P1 initiatives to full scale

**Q4: Assess & Plan Next Year** (P1)
  - Year-end results assessment
  - Lessons learned documentation
  - Next-year strategy refresh based on outcomes

#### Governance
- **Monthly Progress Review** (Monthly): Track P0 task progress, KPI trends, and resource utilization
- **Quarterly Strategic Checkpoint** (Quarterly): Evaluate strategy execution, adjust priorities, reallocate resources
- **Mid-Year Strategic Adjustment** (Semi-annual): Major review of market conditions and strategy effectiveness

#### Strategic Traps to Avoid
