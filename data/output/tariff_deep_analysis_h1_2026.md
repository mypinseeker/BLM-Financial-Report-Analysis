## 1. Mobile Postpaid — Cross-Operator Price Comparison (H1_2026)

### 1.1 Three-Tier Pricing Structure

The German mobile postpaid market has crystallized into three distinct pricing tiers:

| Tier | Operator | Strategy | Tier M Price | Tier M Data | Positioning |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Premium | Deutsche Telekom | Brand premium | €50 | 40GB | "Pay more, get the best network" |
| Mid-premium | Vodafone | Network quality | €33 | 25GB | Caught in the middle |
| Value disruptor | O2 / 1&1 | Price aggression | €20 | 60GB | "More for less" |

### 1.2 Same-Tier Price Gap Analysis

| Tier | Cheapest | Price | Most Expensive | Price | Gap | Premium % |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|-------|-----|-----------|
| S | O2 / 1&1 | €15 | DT | €40 | €25 | **167%** |
| M | O2 / 1&1 | €20 | DT | €50 | €30 | **150%** |
| L | O2 | €25 | DT | €60 | €35 | **140%** |
| XL (unlimited) | 1&1 | €40 | DT | €85 | €45 | **112%** |

**Key insight**: DT commands a 112-167% price premium across all tiers. Vodafone sits uncomfortably between — more expensive than O2/1&1 (by 65-75%) but without DT's brand premium justification.

| 11 | DT | MagentaMobil S | €40 | 20GB | €2.00/GB |
| 12 | Vodafone | GigaMobil S | €25 | 7GB | **€3.57/GB** |

**Key insights**:
- O2's cost per GB is **1/5 of Vodafone** and **1/3.5 of DT** at the L tier
- Vodafone GigaMobil S (€3.57/GB) is the worst value in the entire market — **21x more expensive per GB than O2 Mobile L**
- 1&1 consistently offers 2nd-best value, validating its "best price-performance" positioning

## 3. Price Evolution & Strategic Moves (H1_2023 → H1_2026)

### 3.1 Vodafone Germany — One Major Reset, Then Stable

| Period | Tier S | Tier M | Tier L | Tier XL | Event |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| H1_2023 | €30/5GB | €40/15GB | €50/40GB | €60/Unl | 5G only on L/XL |
| H2_2023 | €30/5GB | €40/15GB | €50/40GB | €60/Unl | No change |
| H1_2024 | €30/5GB | €40/15GB | €50/40GB | €60/Unl | No change |
| **H2_2024** | **€25/7GB** | **€33/25GB** | **€40/50GB** | **€55/Unl** | **Full restructure: -17 to -20% price cut, 5G standard** |
| H1_2025 | €25/7GB | €33/25GB | €40/50GB | €55/Unl | Stable |
| H2_2025 | €25/7GB | €33/25GB | €40/50GB | €55/Unl | Stable |
| H1_2026 | €25/7GB | €33/25GB | €40/50GB | €55/Unl | Stable |

**Strategy**: Reactive price correction in H2_2024 to counter O2/1&1 pressure. Cut prices 17-20% across all tiers while adding 5G as standard. Since then, prices frozen — indicating Vodafone has reached its floor and is unwilling to compete further on price.

### 3.2 Deutsche Telekom — Price Anchored, Volume Doubled

| Period | Tier S | Tier M | Tier L | Tier XL | Event |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| H1_2023 | €40/10GB | €50/20GB | €60/50GB | €85/Unl | 5G standard from day one |
| H2_2023 | €40/10GB | €50/20GB | €60/50GB | €85/Unl | No change |
| H1_2024 | €40/10GB | €50/20GB | €60/50GB | €85/Unl | No change |
| H2_2024 | €40/10GB | €50/20GB | €60/50GB | €85/Unl | No change |
| **H1_2025** | **€40/20GB** | **€50/40GB** | **€60/100GB** | €85/Unl | **Data doubled, prices unchanged** |
| H2_2025 | €40/20GB | €50/40GB | €60/100GB | €85/Unl | Stable |
| H1_2026 | €40/20GB | €50/40GB | €60/100GB | €85/Unl | Stable |

**Strategy**: "Never discount, always add value." DT is the only operator that has **never reduced prices** in 3 years. Instead, doubled data allowances in H1_2025. This is a textbook premium brand defense — protect ARPU at all costs. DT was also the only operator with 5G on all postpaid plans from H1_2023 onward.

### 3.3 Telefónica O2 — Most Aggressive Disruptor

| Period | Tier S | Tier M | Tier L | Tier XL | Event |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| H1_2023 | €15/6GB | €25/25GB | €35/70GB | €55/Unl | "O2 Free" brand, 5G only L/XL |
| **H2_2023** | €15/6GB | **€23/30GB** | **€30/100GB** | **€50/Unl** | **Rebrand to "O2 Mobile", 5G on all plans** |
| H1_2024 | €15/6GB | €23/30GB | €30/100GB | €50/Unl | Stable |
| **H2_2024** | **€15/10GB** | **€20/60GB** | **€25/150GB** | **€60/Unl** | **Product revolution: 11→6 plans, "Grow" auto-increment, massive value increase** |
| H1_2025 | €15/10GB | €20/60GB | €25/150GB | €60/Unl | Stable |
| H2_2025 | €15/10GB | €20/60GB | €25/150GB | €60/Unl | Stable |
| H1_2026 | €15/10GB | €20/60GB | €25/150GB | €60/Unl | Stable |

**Strategy**: Two major disruptions in 18 months — the most aggressive pricing strategy in the German market.

- **H2_2023**: Brand unification + 5G democratization. Lowered barriers by making 5G standard.
- **H2_2024**: Radical simplification. Cut M from €23→€20, L from €30→€25, while tripling data (M: 30→60GB, L: 100→150GB). Introduced "Grow" — data allowance automatically increases each year at same price.
- **XL paradox**: Unlimited price *increased* €50→€60. Deliberate strategy to funnel mainstream users toward the hyper-value L tier (€25/150GB) rather than unlimited.

O2's H2_2024 move was the single most aggressive pricing action in the German market over the 3-year period, and directly triggered Vodafone's H2_2024 price restructure.

### 3.4 1&1 — MVNO-to-MNO Pricing Transition

| Period | Tier S | Tier M | Tier L | Tier XL | Event |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| H1_2023 | €10/10GB | €15/20GB | €25/50GB | €35/Unl | MVNO phase, no 5G, lowest prices in market |
| H2_2023 | €10/10GB | €15/20GB | €25/50GB | €35/Unl | No change |
| **H1_2024** | **€15/30GB** | **€20/60GB** | **€30/120GB** | **€40/Unl** | **Own network launch: +14 to +50% price increase, 5G standard, massive data boost** |
| H2_2024 | €15/30GB | €20/60GB | €30/120GB | €40/Unl | Stable |
| H1_2025 | €15/30GB | €20/60GB | €30/120GB | €40/Unl | Stable |
| H2_2025 | €15/30GB | €20/60GB | €30/120GB | €40/Unl | Stable |
| H1_2026 | €15/30GB | €20/60GB | €30/120GB | €40/Unl | Stable |

**Strategy**: Successfully repositioned from "cheapest MVNO" to "best price-performance MNO."

- H1_2024 price increases (14-50%) were justified by own-network 5G + 2-3x data increases
- Now price-matches O2 at S/M tiers (€15/€20) while offering more data at S tier (30GB vs 10GB)
- Remains the cheapest unlimited provider in Germany (€40 vs Vodafone €55, O2 €60, DT €85)

## 4. Fixed Broadband Comparison — H1_2026

### 4.1 DSL

| Operator | Plan | Speed | Price | €/Mbps |
|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| O2 | my Home S | 10 Mbps | €25 | €2.50 |
| O2 | my Home M | 50 Mbps | €30 | €0.60 |
| Vodafone | DSL 50 | 50 Mbps | €30 | €0.60 |
| 1&1 | DSL 50 | 50 Mbps | €30 | €0.60 |
| DT | MagentaZuhause S | 16 Mbps | €35 | €2.19 |
| O2 | my Home L | 100 Mbps | €35 | €0.35 |
| Vodafone | DSL 100 | 100 Mbps | €35 | €0.35 |
| 1&1 | DSL 100 | 100 Mbps | €35 | €0.35 |
| DT | MagentaZuhause M | 50 Mbps | €40 | €0.80 |
| 1&1 | DSL 250 | 250 Mbps | €40 | €0.16 |
| DT | MagentaZuhause L | 100 Mbps | €45 | €0.45 |

**Insight**: DT charges €40 for 50 Mbps DSL while O2/VF/1&1 charge €30 for the same speed. 1&1 is the only operator offering 250 Mbps VDSL at a competitive €40.

### 4.2 Cable

| Operator | Plan | Speed | Price |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Vodafone | GigaZuhause 250 Kabel | 250 Mbps | €35 |
| Vodafone | GigaZuhause 500 Kabel | 500 Mbps | €40 |
| Vodafone | GigaZuhause 1000 Kabel | 1000 Mbps | €50 |
| DT | MagentaZuhause XL Cable | 250 Mbps | €50 |

**Insight**: Vodafone dominates cable with Germany's largest cable network. 1000 Mbps for €50 vs DT's 250 Mbps for €50 — **Vodafone delivers 4x the speed at the same price**. Cable is Vodafone's strongest competitive asset.

### 4.3 Fiber (FTTH)

| Speed Tier | O2 | 1&1 | Vodafone | DT |
|------------|-----|-----|----------|-----|
| 100 Mbps | — | — | — | €40 |
| 250-300 Mbps | €35 | €40 | €40 | €45 |
| 500-600 Mbps | €45 | — | €45 | €55 |
| 1000 Mbps | — | €50 | €55 | **€65** |

**Insight**: DT is most expensive at every fiber tier. At 1000 Mbps: DT €65 vs 1&1 €50 — a 30% premium. O2 offers the best entry fiber price at €35/300Mbps.

## 5. FMC Bundle Comparison — H1_2026

| Tier | O2 | 1&1 | Vodafone | DT | DT Premium % |
|------|-----|-----|----------|----|-------------|
| Basic | €35 | €35 | €50 | €65 | **86% vs O2/1&1** |
| Premium | €60 | €60 | €80 | €120 | **100% vs O2/1&1** |

**Key insights**:
- DT Premium FMC (€120) is **double** the price of O2/1&1 (€60) — the largest relative gap in any product category
- Vodafone's GigaKombi Basic (€50) is 43% above O2/1&1, but below DT
- High FMC price barriers hurt cross-sell penetration for both DT and Vodafone
- O2/1&1 FMC packages are aggressive loss-leaders designed to lock in multi-product customers

---

## 6. TV Comparison — H1_2026

| Tier | 1&1 | O2 | Vodafone | DT |
|------|------|-----|----------|-----|
| Basic | €5 | €7 | €10 (Net) | €10 (Flex) |
| Standard | €10 | €10 | €15 (Cable) | €15 (Smart) |
| Premium | — | — | €25 (Netflix) | €20 (Disney+) |

**Insight**: 1&1 and O2 are cheapest. Vodafone/DT compete on content bundles (Netflix vs Disney+) as differentiators at the premium tier. TV alone is not a significant revenue driver but serves as FMC attachment.

---

## 7. 5G Premium Erosion Timeline

| Period | 5G Plans | Non-5G Plans | Avg 5G Price | Avg non-5G Price | Premium |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| H1_2023 | 8 | 8 | €54.40 | €24.40 | **+123%** |
| H2_2023 | 10 | 6 | €46.30 | €25.80 | **+79%** |
| H1_2024 | 14 | 2 | €40.60 | €35.00 | **+16%** |
| H2_2024 | 16 | 0 | €38.30 | — | **0% (5G is standard)** |
| H1_2025 | 16 | 0 | €38.30 | — | 0% |
| H2_2025 | 16 | 0 | €38.30 | — | 0% |
| H1_2026 | 16 | 0 | €38.30 | — | 0% |

**Key insight**: 5G went from a **+123% premium differentiator** to a **standard feature in just 18 months** (H1_2023 → H2_2024). Operators must now find differentiation beyond 5G — network quality, latency, convergence, B2B services.

## 8. Strategic Implications for Vodafone Germany

### 8.1 The "Squeezed Middle" Problem

Vodafone occupies an uncomfortable pricing position in every product category:
- **Not cheap enough** to compete with O2/1&1 on value (65-75% more expensive in mobile)
- **Not premium enough** to justify DT-level pricing (lacks DT's brand equity and fiber leadership)
- **€/GB is near-worst**: GigaMobil S at €3.57/GB is 21x worse than O2 Mobile L at €0.17/GB

### 8.2 Cable: The Crown Jewel

Cable broadband is Vodafone's **only area of clear pricing superiority**:
- 1000 Mbps at €50 vs DT's 250 Mbps cable at €50 (4x speed advantage)
- Cable infrastructure covers ~24M German households
- This should be the cornerstone of Vodafone's FMC and retention strategy

### 8.3 Mobile Low-End Requires Repricing

GigaMobil S (€25/7GB) delivers the worst value in the German market. Options:
- **Increase data to 15-20GB** at same price (DT playbook)
- **Cut price to €20** to close the gap with O2/1&1 (€15)
- **Either way, €3.57/GB is unsustainable** against O2's €0.17/GB in the price-sensitive segment

### 8.4 FMC as the Competitive Equalizer

FMC is where Vodafone's price gap is smallest relative to value:
- GigaKombi Basic (€50) is only 43% above O2/1&1 (vs 65-167% in mobile alone)
- Cable speed advantage (250-1000 Mbps) partially justifies the premium
- **Recommendation**: Increase FMC attach rate by offering deeper GigaKombi discounts; Vodafone's cable + mobile combination is a unique value proposition that neither O2 nor 1&1 can match

### 8.5 Competitive Response Priorities

| Priority | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Rebalance GigaMobil S/M data allowances | €/GB gap is largest at low tiers; risk of mass defection to O2/1&1 |
| 2 | Accelerate GigaKombi cross-sell | Cable speed advantage = sustainable differentiation |
| 3 | Monitor O2 "Grow" feature adoption | Auto-increasing data is a retention innovation; consider matching |
| 4 | Defend unlimited tier pricing | €55 is competitive vs O2 (€60) and far below DT (€85) |
| 5 | Fiber pricing must match or beat DT | Currently €10 cheaper at 1000 Mbps — maintain this gap |
