# Tigo Colombia — BLM Strategic Assessment: Complete Analysis

> **Period**: CQ4_2025 (Q4 2025)
> **Framework**: Business Leadership Model (BLM) — Five Looks + SWOT + SPAN
> **Protagonist**: Tigo Colombia (Millicom / Tigo-UNE)
> **Market**: Colombian Telecommunications
> **Generated**: 2026-02-27 (verified data refresh)
> **Population**: 52M | **Currency**: COP (~3,790 COP/USD Q4 2025)
> **Data Rule**: All figures sourced from verified public disclosures only — no estimates

## ⚠ Critical Timeline Correction

> **Previous versions incorrectly stated Coltel acquisition closed in Q3 2025. Verified: the tender offer concluded February 5, 2026 and closed February 6, 2026. Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec 2025) data reflects a PRE-acquisition market: 4 operators, Tigo-UNE still a 50% JV with EPM.**

| Event | Actual Date | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Millicom wins EPM auction (100% of Tigo-UNE) | **January 27, 2026** | Millicom Q4 2025 Earnings |
| Millicom closes Coltel/Movistar acquisition | **February 6, 2026** | Millicom PR / GlobeNewsWire |
| Purchase price (Telefónica's 67.5% stake) | **$214.4M** | Millicom PR |
| Government's 32.5% stake (Phase 2) | **~April 2026 (expected)** | Infobae |

# Executive Summary

## One-Line Verdict

**Tigo-UNE achieved a record 44.1% EBITDA margin in FY 2025 — exceeding Claro's 41.0% — even before the Coltel acquisition. Post-closing (Feb 2026), combined spectrum reaches 345 MHz (#1, including 80 MHz at 3.5 GHz from joint auction bid), far ahead of Claro's 280 MHz. Mobile subs ~36-41M (~43%), approaching Claro's 42.7M. The 12-18 month integration window is critical.**

## Market Snapshot (Q4 2025 — Pre-Acquisition)

| Metric | Value | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue-Generating Mobile Lines | **~46.7M** (only 45.6% of registered SIMs) | CRC / DPL News |
| Mobile Internet Accesses | **49.4M** | CRC |
| 5G Connections | **6.03M** (12.4% of mobile internet) | CRC |
| 5G Growth | +185.5% YoY | CRC |
| Mobile Internet Revenue | COP 2.9T/Q (+10.9%) | CRC |
| Population | 52M | World Bank |
| GDP Growth | 1.8% | IMF / DANE |
| Exchange Rate | ~3,790 COP/USD | Market |

> ⚠ **SIM Line Counting — Why "102.5M" Is Misleading**: CRC's official 102.5M figure counts ALL registered SIM cards including **dormant prepaid SIMs that generate zero revenue (54.4% of total)**. This inflates Colombia's apparent mobile penetration to ~197%. The economically meaningful market size is **~46.7M revenue-generating lines** or **~49.4M mobile internet accesses**. GSMA counts 78.3M using its own methodology. **CRC does not separately track IoT/M2M**. For this report, we use revenue and spectrum as competitive metrics — not SIM line counts, which are distorted by dormant registrations.

## Market Structure (Q4 2025 — 4 Operators, Revenue-Based)

> ⚠ SIM-line market shares (CRC) are unreliable for competitive analysis because 54.4% of counted SIMs are dormant. **Revenue and EBITDA are the only meaningful competitive comparisons.** CRC does not publish operator-level revenue market shares.

| Operator | Verified Revenue | EBITDA Margin | Spectrum (incl. 3.5 GHz) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claro** (AMX) | COP 4.3T (Q4) ~$1.13B | **41.0%** | **280 MHz** (200+80) | AMX Q4 2025 |
| **Tigo-UNE** (Millicom) | $389M (FY 2025) | **44.1%** ★ | 225 MHz (145+80†) | Millicom Q4 2025 |
| **Movistar/Coltel** (→Tigo) | Not disclosed (in acquisition) | N/A | 120 MHz (+80†) | — |
| **WOM** (SUR Holdings) | Not disclosed | First profit Q1 2025 | **140 MHz** (60+80) | SUR / media |

> † 3.5 GHz Block 1 (80 MHz) was won by **Tigo-Movistar joint bid** ("Unión Temporal") at the Dec 2023 auction. Post-acquisition, Tigo consolidates the full block.

> **Note on subscriber counts**: AMX reports 42.7M "wireless clients" for Claro (incl. IoT SIMs); Millicom discloses 4.4M postpaid only; WOM has ~7M from multiple sources. These figures use different counting methodologies and are **not directly comparable** to each other or to CRC's 102.5M total.

## Post-Acquisition Outlook (After Feb 2026)

| Dimension | Tigo+Coltel | Claro | WOM |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mobile Subs | **~36-41M** (~43%) | 42.7M (~44%) | ~7M (~7%) |
| Spectrum (sub-3 GHz) | **265 MHz** ★ | 200 MHz | 60 MHz |
| Spectrum (3.5 GHz) | **80 MHz** (joint bid consolidated) | 80 MHz | 80 MHz |
| **Total Spectrum** | **345 MHz** ★ | **280 MHz** | **140 MHz** |
| Market Structure | 3 effective operators | — | — |

> Telecall (Brazilian newcomer) also won 80 MHz at 3.5 GHz but **defaulted on payment** — MinTIC is revoking this block (Jan 2025). This spectrum will likely return to state for reassignment.

## Three Decisions

### Decision 1: Strategy

**"Leverage record EBITDA efficiency (44.1%) as the integration platform, execute Coltel merger to achieve spectrum leadership (265 MHz) and subscriber parity (~36-41M vs Claro's 42.7M) within 12-18 months."**

### Decision 2: Priorities

| Priority | Content | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| #1 Coltel Integration | Complete core integration in 12 months | Spectrum refarming; brand unification; network integration |
| #2 Margin Protection | Maintain 44.1%+ EBITDA margin | Integration synergies; cost optimization |
| #3 5G + Broadband | Exploit 265 MHz advantage | Expand 5G coverage; consolidate fiber (Tigo+Coltel ~8M HP) |

### Decision 3: Execution Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Milestones |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phase 1 | 2026 Q1-Q2 | Spectrum refarming; brand planning; network assessment |
| Phase 2 | 2026 Q3-Q4 | RAN consolidation; subscriber migration; 5G to 25% |
| Phase 3 | 2027 H1 | Integration complete; synergies realized; 3.5 GHz auction |
