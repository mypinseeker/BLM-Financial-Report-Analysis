# Executive Summary

## One-Line Verdict

**Tigo Panama commands the highest EBITDA margin in Panama's duopoly (51.9% vs 40.9%), matching +Móvil's absolute EBITDA ($94M each in Q4 2025) despite 21% lower revenue. Core strategy should leverage the exclusive AWS band (40 MHz) and superior operational efficiency to maintain profitability leadership while closing the coverage gap.**

## Critical Market Event: 2022 Restructuring

| Event | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| CWP acquires Claro | Cable & Wireless Panama (Liberty Latin America) completed acquisition of América Móvil's Panama operations in mid-2022 |
| Brand consolidation | Claro brand phased out; combined entity operates as **+Móvil** |
| Digicel exit | Digicel voluntarily liquidated Panama operations in April 2022 |
| Exit reason | High spectrum costs + uncompetitive environment post CWP-Claro merger |
| Spectrum return | Digicel's spectrum (700+1900 MHz, 50 MHz) returned to ASEP |
| ASEP re-tender | License No.106 (2×15 MHz@1900 + 2×10 MHz@700) under public tender |

| Fiber Homepass | 250K | 650K | -61.5% | Operator reports |
| AWS Band | **40 MHz** ★ | **0 MHz** | **Exclusive** | ASEP |

### Key Competitive Insights

1. **EBITDA parity** — Both operators generated exactly $94M EBITDA in Q4 2025, despite Tigo's 21% smaller revenue base. This demonstrates Tigo's dramatically superior operating efficiency.
2. **Margin leadership** — Tigo's 51.9% EBITDA margin leads +Móvil by 11.0 percentage points, the strongest competitive moat in this duopoly.
3. **+Móvil growing faster** — Revenue +10% vs +4.9%, EBITDA +18% vs +4.5%. +Móvil is closing the margin gap (+300bps/year improvement).
4. **Spectrum gap** — Tigo holds only 94 MHz vs +Móvil's 136 MHz, but Tigo's exclusive AWS B4 (40 MHz) is the largest single LTE capacity block in Panama.

## Spectrum Advantage Analysis

| Dimension | Tigo | +Móvil | Tigo Status | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total Spectrum | 94 MHz | 136 MHz | **-30.9%** | Material disadvantage |
| Sub-1 GHz | 44 MHz | 66 MHz | -33.3% | Coverage layer gap |
| Mid-band (1-3 GHz) | 50 MHz | 70 MHz | -28.6% | Capacity gap smaller |
| AWS Exclusive | **40 MHz** ★ | 0 MHz | **Exclusive** | **Core differentiator** |
| LTE Band Count | 4 (B28/B5/B2/B4) | 2 (B28/B2) | **+2 bands** | Carrier aggregation advantage |

### Key Insights

1. **AWS exclusive is Tigo's strategic weapon**: +Móvil has zero AWS spectrum; its LTE runs on only B28 and B2. Tigo's B4 (40 MHz) is the largest single LTE capacity block in Panama, supporting superior data rates in high-density areas.
2. **Carrier aggregation advantage**: Tigo can utilize 4 LTE bands (B28+B5+B2+B4) for 4CC carrier aggregation, vs +Móvil's 2 bands (B28+B2). Peak throughput advantage is significant.
3. **Sub-1 GHz gap**: Combined 700+850 MHz, +Móvil holds 66 MHz vs Tigo's 44 MHz (-33%). +Móvil has stronger rural/indoor coverage, partially offset by Tigo's AWS urban capacity.
4. **ASEP pending spectrum**: 50 MHz ex-Digicel spectrum under tender. If Tigo acquires (especially 20 MHz@700), total reaches 144 MHz, overtaking +Móvil. If Gitpan wins, market returns to 3-player structure.
5. **5G forward**: No 5G spectrum auction yet in Panama (3.5 GHz / 26 GHz). Both operators start equal. Tigo can leverage AWS DSS capability for early 5G service.

# Three Decisions

## Strategic Theme

**"Leverage superior operational efficiency (51.9% EBITDA margin) and exclusive AWS advantage as shield; fiber expansion and postpaid growth as sword — establish premium differentiation in the duopoly."**

## Decision 1: Strategy — Focus on Differentiation

| Dimension | Choice | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Competitive strategy | **Differentiation** | 21% smaller revenue but equal EBITDA — efficiency is the core moat |
| Differentiation vector | Network quality + convergence + operational efficiency | AWS exclusive + fiber build + postpaid conversion |
| Growth model | Organic growth + spectrum acquisition | ASEP tender is the key variable |

## Decision 2: Priorities — Three Strategic Pillars

| Priority | Content | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **#1 Efficiency + Network Quality** | Maintain 51.9% margin + AWS advantage | Ericsson DSS upgrade; VoLTE launch; 4CC CA deployment |
| **#2 Fixed Broadband Catch-up** | Fiber expansion + convergent bundles | Accelerate FTTH construction; launch Tigo One bundles |
| **#3 Spectrum Strategy** | ASEP tender + 5G planning | Evaluate ex-Digicel bid; prepare 3.5 GHz 5G budget |

## Decision 3: Execution Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Phase 1 | 2026 H1 | VoLTE launch; ASEP tender evaluation; postpaid push |
| Phase 2 | 2026 H2 | 4CC carrier aggregation network-wide; Canal Zone B2B |
| Phase 3 | 2027 H1 | DSS 5G trial (AWS band); convergent bundle penetration |
| Phase 4 | 2027 H2 | 3.5 GHz 5G auction participation; B2B IoT at scale |
