## Executive Summary

This report applies the **Business Leadership Model (BLM)** framework to analyze three major German-headquartered (or German-market significant) companies — **Deutsche Telekom AG**, **Vodafone Group Plc**, and **SAP SE** — based on their 2023 fiscal year financial reports.

**Key Findings:**

- **Deutsche Telekom** demonstrated the strongest all-round BLM performance, with robust execution across all dimensions and a clear "Leading Digital Telco" strategic vision. Revenue of €112.0B and adjusted EBITDA AL of €40.5B underscore world-class operational scale.
- **SAP** leads in innovation and strategic transformation, pivoting aggressively to cloud and AI. Cloud revenue surged 20% to €13.66B, though the €2B restructuring (8,000 roles) signals execution risk during transition.
- **Vodafone** faces the most significant strategic and execution challenges, with declining revenues (€36.7B, -2.5%), portfolio reshaping (Spain/Italy disposals), and a struggling Germany segment. Its 11,000-role reduction plan reflects deep operational restructuring.

#### Deutsche Telekom Gap Analysis

**Performance Gap (业绩差距):**
- Reported revenue declined 2.1% due to currency effects, masking 0.6% organic growth — the gap between reported and organic performance creates investor perception challenges
- Adjusted net profit fell 12.6% due to non-recurring items — underlying profitability needs to strengthen

**Opportunity Gap (机会差距):**
- European operations lag US growth rates — opportunity to replicate T-Mobile US's aggressive strategy in European markets
- B2B/enterprise digital services remain underdeveloped relative to the consumer business
- Edge computing and IoT monetization represent untapped infrastructure leverage

---

**Ticker:** VOD (LSE) | **Sector:** Telecommunications
**FY2024 Revenue (YE March 2024):** €36.7 billion | **Adjusted EBITDAaL:** €11.0 billion

> **Note:** Vodafone's fiscal year ends March 31. FY2024 (April 2023–March 2024) is used for calendar year 2023 alignment. Spain and Italy treated as discontinued operations.

#### Financial Overview

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2023 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Revenue | €36.7B | €37.7B | -2.5% |
| Service Revenue | €29.9B | €30.3B | -1.3% (organic +6.3%) |
| Adjusted EBITDAaL | €11.0B | €12.4B | -5.8% (organic +2.2%) |
| EBITDAaL Margin | 38.7% | — | -1.9pp |
| Operating Profit | €3.7B | €14.5B | -74.6% |

---

#### Strategy Dimensions (战略)

##### Market Insight (市场洞察) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Portfolio reshaping | Exited Spain, Italy, Hungary, Ghana — narrowing geographic focus |
| Germany challenges | Largest market by revenue but declining profitability |
| Convergence gap | Lagging peers in fixed-mobile convergence, especially in Germany |
| Competitive pressure | Facing aggressive competition from Deutsche Telekom and 1&1 |

Vodafone recognizes the need to refocus on markets where it has strong positions, but the Germany segment — its largest market — shows concerning trends. The MDU (multi-dwelling unit) cable transition is a structural challenge unique to Vodafone Germany.

##### Strategic Intent (战略意图) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Transformation plan | "Reshape European footprint" focused on growth markets |
| Scale ambitions | Growing in all segments and accelerating through the year |
| Leverage target | Maintained at 2.5x, prudent but limits investment capacity |
| Shareholder returns | Dividend maintained at 9.0c despite earnings pressure |

The strategic intent is visible but reactive rather than proactive. The portfolio reshaping addresses past mistakes (overexpansion) rather than pursuing new growth frontiers. The maintained dividend signals confidence but strains cash flow.

##### Innovation Focus (创新焦点) — Rating: **Weak (1/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| R&D investment | Not prominently reported — telecom capex-focused rather than innovation-led |
| Network investment | Stepped-up investment in customer experience |
| Digital services | Limited evidence of differentiated digital product innovation |
| Technology strategy | Following industry trends rather than setting them |

Vodafone's innovation posture is primarily infrastructure maintenance rather than frontier innovation. Unlike Deutsche Telekom's FWA disruption or SAP's AI pivot, Vodafone lacks a clearly differentiated innovation narrative.

##### Business Design (业务设计) — Rating: **Weak (1/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Revenue quality | Revenue declining, margins compressing |
| Disposals | Spain/Italy exits reduce scale without improving growth rate |
| Debt burden | €33.2B net debt constrains strategic flexibility |
| Cash generation | FCF halved from €4.1B to €2.6B |

The business design is under stress. Revenue is declining, margins are compressing, and the debt load limits strategic optionality. The disposal program addresses portfolio composition but doesn't solve the underlying growth challenge.

---

#### Execution Dimensions (执行)

##### Critical Tasks (关键任务) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Portfolio exits | Successfully completed Spain/Italy disposals |
| Cost reduction | 5,000 roles reduced + 2,000 more announced (Year 1 of 11,000 plan) |
| Germany MDU | Managing cable-to-fiber transition (structural challenge) |
| Guidance met | FY24 results ahead of expectations |

##### Formal Organization (正式组织) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Restructuring | Major organizational reshaping underway |
| Country model | Shifting from country-centric to shared service model |
| Leadership | New strategic direction under CEO Margherita Della Valle |
| Governance | Active board oversight of transformation |

##### Talent (人才) — Rating: **Weak (1/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Headcount reduction | 11,000-role reduction over 3 years — massive restructuring |
| Morale risk | Large-scale layoffs create engagement and retention challenges |
| Skills gap | Need digital/AI skills while reducing overall headcount |
| Competitive market | Competing with tech companies for digital talent while cutting roles |

The 11,000-role reduction plan is the most aggressive workforce restructuring among the three companies analyzed. While necessary for cost alignment, it creates significant execution risk around talent retention and organizational capability.

##### Culture & Climate (氛围与文化) — Rating: **Weak (1/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Restructuring impact | Large-scale role reductions affect morale and culture |
| Strategic uncertainty | Market exits and organizational changes create instability |
| ESG commitments | Maintains sustainability commitments but execution is secondary |
| Employee experience | "Step-up investment in customer experience" — internal focus unclear |

---

#### Vodafone Gap Analysis

**Performance Gap (业绩差距):**
- Revenue declining 2.5% reported, even organic service revenue growth (+6.3%) cannot offset portfolio reduction effects
- FCF halved from €4.1B to €2.6B — severely limiting reinvestment capacity
- Germany segment EBITDAaL declining 5.8% — core market underperformance is critical
- EPS collapsed from 43.66c to 4.45c (though prior year was inflated by disposal gains)

**Opportunity Gap (机会差距):**
- German fiber-to-the-home rollout lags Deutsche Telekom significantly
- B2B enterprise connectivity services undermonetized
- IoT/M2M platform potential not capitalized despite large customer base
- Convergence products (fixed-mobile bundles) underdeveloped vs. Deutsche Telekom

### 3. SAP SE

**Ticker:** SAP (XETRA) | **Sector:** Enterprise Software
**FY2023 Revenue:** €31.21 billion | **Non-IFRS Operating Profit:** €8.72 billion

#### Financial Overview

| Metric | FY2023 | FY2022 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total Revenue | €31.21B | €29.5B | +6% (+9% cc) |
| Cloud Revenue | €13.66B | €11.4B | +20% (+23% cc) |
| S/4HANA Cloud Revenue | €3.49B | — | +67% (+72% cc) |

| Non-IFRS Operating Margin | 27.9% | — | +0.9pp |
| Net Income (continuing) | €3.56B | — | +16% |
| Free Cash Flow | €5.08B | — | +16% |
| R&D Expenditure | ~€6.3B | ~€5.3B | +19% |
| Employees (FTE) | 107,602 | 111,961 | -3.9% |
| Current Cloud Backlog | €13.75B | — | +25% (+27% cc) |
| Total Cloud Backlog | €44.0B | — | +37% (+39% cc) |

---

#### Strategy Dimensions (战略)

##### Market Insight (市场洞察) — Rating: **Strong (3/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Cloud transition | Correctly identified cloud-native ERP as industry direction |
| AI opportunity | Early mover in embedding AI into enterprise software (Business AI) |
| Customer behavior | 81% of revenue now "more predictable" (recurring/subscription) |
| Market position | Dominant enterprise ERP position being leveraged into cloud |

SAP demonstrates exceptional market insight by recognizing and acting on the enterprise software industry's three mega-trends: cloud migration, AI integration, and platform ecosystem expansion. The cloud backlog of €44B provides unmatched revenue visibility.

##### Strategic Intent (战略意图) — Rating: **Strong (3/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Cloud-first vision | Clear, multi-year cloud transformation with measurable targets |
| 2025 ambitions | Cloud >€21.5B, Revenue >€37.5B, Non-IFRS OP ~€10B |
| 2024 guidance | Cloud €17.0-17.3B (+24-27% cc) |
| Transformation investment | Willing to accept short-term margin pressure for long-term positioning |

SAP's strategic intent is the most clearly articulated and quantified among the three companies. The 2025 ambitions provide a concrete North Star, and the willingness to accept €2B in restructuring costs demonstrates commitment.

##### Innovation Focus (创新焦点) — Rating: **Strong (3/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| R&D investment | ~€6.3B in R&D (+19% YoY) — 20.2% of revenue |
| AI strategy | "Business AI" as core strategic pillar |
| S/4HANA Cloud | Revenue +67% — rapid adoption of next-gen ERP |
| Cloud platform | Expanding BTP (Business Technology Platform) ecosystem |
| Stock performance | +43.2% in 2023, reflecting market confidence in innovation |

SAP is the clear innovation leader among the three companies. R&D spend of €6.3B (20.2% of revenue) dwarfs the telecom companies' investment rates. The S/4HANA Cloud's 67% growth validates the innovation strategy.

##### Business Design (业务设计) — Rating: **Strong (3/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Revenue model shift | Cloud (recurring) growing at 20%, licenses (one-time) declining 14% |
| Predictability | 81% of revenue is now recurring/predictable |
| Margin expansion | Non-IFRS margin improving +0.9pp to 27.9% despite transition |
| Cloud economics | Cloud gross margin 71.6% (+2.2pp) — improving unit economics |
| Cash generation | FCF €5.08B (+16%) — strong and growing |

SAP's business model transformation is a textbook example of strategic business design. The deliberate shift from license to subscription creates a more predictable, higher-quality revenue stream. The improving cloud gross margin (71.6%) shows the model is scaling efficiently.

---

#### Execution Dimensions (执行)

##### Critical Tasks (关键任务) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Cloud migration | On track — all 2023 targets met or exceeded |
| Restructuring | €2B program affecting 8,000 roles — major execution risk |
| AI integration | Business AI being embedded across product portfolio |
| Customer migration | S/4HANA Cloud +67% shows strong customer adoption |
| Risk factor | Restructuring may cause 2024 FCF dip to ~€3.5B before recovery |

While cloud execution is excellent, the 8,000-role restructuring program introduces near-term execution risk. The projected FCF dip in 2024 (to ~€3.5B from €5.08B) reflects the cost of transformation.

##### Formal Organization (正式组织) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Restructuring | Major organizational redesign underway for AI/cloud era |
| Leadership | CEO Christian Klein driving transformation agenda |
| Structure | Shifting resources from legacy to cloud/AI capabilities |
| Challenge | 8,000-role restructuring creates organizational turbulence |

##### Talent (人才) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Headcount | 107,602 FTEs (-3.9% YoY) — net reduction despite growth |
| Restructuring approach | "Voluntary leave + internal re-skilling" — more humane than layoffs |
| R&D workforce | Majority of employees in R&D — high-skill workforce |
| AI reskilling | Focus on reskilling workforce for AI/cloud capabilities |

SAP's approach to restructuring — emphasizing voluntary leave and reskilling — is more strategically sound than pure headcount reduction. However, losing 8,000 roles from a 108K-person company is still a significant organizational event.

##### Culture & Climate (氛围与文化) — Rating: **Moderate (2/3)**

| Evidence | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Innovation culture | Strong R&D DNA; developer-centric culture |
| Stock performance | +43.2% stock appreciation boosts employee morale (equity compensation) |
| Restructuring risk | Major headcount changes create cultural uncertainty |
| ESG reporting | Integrated Report format shows commitment to stakeholder transparency |

---

#### SAP Gap Analysis

**Performance Gap (业绩差距):**
- IFRS operating profit declined 5% while non-IFRS improved 9% — the gap between IFRS and non-IFRS measures reflects restructuring and transition costs
- Software license revenue declining 14% — the legacy business is eroding faster than cloud can compensate in profit terms
- 2024 FCF expected to dip to ~€3.5B from €5.08B — transformation costs temporarily impair cash generation

**Opportunity Gap (机会差距):**
- AI monetization is early-stage — Business AI has potential to be a major revenue accelerator but is not yet materially contributing
- Industry cloud solutions are an emerging vertical opportunity not yet at scale
- Global mid-market ERP (via cloud) represents a TAM expansion opportunity beyond traditional enterprise
- Partner ecosystem monetization (BTP marketplace) is nascent
